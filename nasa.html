                Preliminary Research

                How to begin work in an unfamiliar field with high levels of complexity?

                To gain an understanding of a technical problem space I was
                largely unfamiliar with, I looked into three major areas 
                when conducting prelimary research: 

                1. Previous SUITS publications:
                Although the SUITS challenge is different every year, other teams had a lot
                of valuable research and findings to provide.
                
                2. NASA AR Research Projects: 
                NASA and their partners have been 
                exploring and testing many AR-based applications to assist with
                a variety of space-related tasks.

                3. Apollo Transcripts: 
                Given that Apollo was the last time NASA sent 
                astronauts to the moon, the audio transcripts for each mission were a 
                treasure trove of data for identifying real user pain points in an 
                environment far, far away.

                User Interview with Jay Apt

                Pain Points
                Based on this research, Anita and I were able to determine the 
                primary pain points, which ultimately shaped our core design goals.
        
                1. Pain Point: Poor Mobility in Spacesuit
                    Goal: MoonBuddy must be operable while users 
                    are wearing EVA gloves and while executing dexterous tasks.
        
                2. Pain Point: Limited Vision from Helmet + Harsh Lighting COnditions
                    Goal: MoonBuddy must provide environmental awareness of
                    hazardous regions and be unobtrusive to astronaut view.
        
                3. Pain Point: Limited Communication with MCC
                    Goal: MoonBuddy must give both the MCC and astronauts the 
                    autonomy to modify tasks and mission procedure at any point in the EVA.
        
                4. Pain Point: Cognitive Overload 
                    Goal: MoonBuddy must provide information in a simple manner and 
                    limit information to show only what is needed.

<p>
    Future space exploration missions will have an increased need for 
    equipping astronauts with the autonomy-enabling tools they need for 
    the elevated demands of lunar surface exploration and extreme terrestrial access.
</p>
<p> 
    NASA has invested in AR as a solution in the form of JARVIS, a 
    Joint Augmented Reality Visual Informatics System that is integrated
    directly into the spacesuit.
</p>  
    To meet NASA's open challenge to design an AR information display 
    for lunar exploration, our team developed MoonBuddy, a voice-based AR
    application that integrates navigation, task assistance, documentation
    tools, and hazard avoidance through geometry-aware surface highlighting.

</p>
        
       


        Design Explorations
        Our design team continously iterated our designs through weekly feedback
        sessions with the rest of our team and our mentor from NASA.

        - snapshots -
        (Month Year) Feature

        Final Design
        Below is the final design on the HoloLens2 that our team 
        tested with multiple stakeholders at Johnson Space Center in June 2022. 

        Design System
        
        1. Onboarding
        Users are onboarded through a hybrid method to get used to the 
        voice commands and visual layout.

        2. Navigation
        Users can say "Go to Point X" for visual guidance to their next location.

        3. Science Sampling
        Users are walked through the sampling process for the specific types of
        samples they've found at their destination site.

        4. Lunar Search and Rescue
        Users can recieve alerts about crew members in distress and respond
        quickly and efficiently. 

        5. Hazard Avoidance
        Users can utilize the spatial mapping feature to easily detect 
        obstacles such as rocks and craters.        

        User Testing Results 
        We were able to conduct 2 user testing sessions at the JSC Rock Yard 
        under simulated lunar lighting conditions btween 7pm and midnight.

        Participants went through a 45-minute training before preceding to 
        the experiemental session, where they were tasked to navigate to 3
        different sampling sites and document rock samples. A LSAR message
        was sent at a random time within the testing session, and we
        concluded with a short debrief to gather user feedback.

        Users appreciated...
        1. The simple voice commands and guided nature of MoonBuddy, 
        especially during the more complicated geological sampling tasks.
        2. The surface edge detection feature that allowed them to 
        avoid rocks in the darkness.
        3. The intuitive and easy to use UI 

        Users wished that...
        1. AR navigation could be anchored to the real world to add
        superimposed landmarks in an environment that lacks them.
        2. There was adapative brightness for UI elements to balance visibility. 


        Reflection

        While this was our team's first and last year working on this project,
        we saw a lot of opportunities for further refinement in the future, 
        especially through more experimentation with AR's unique ability to 
        directly interact and impact an astronaut's immediate surroundings.
